WARNING: This is a work in progress

#Installation
Clone this repository and run `tsc` to compile (you need TypeScript installed, `npm i -g typescript`).
Prior to running the application, make sure you configure any config files to your bot token/SC logins.
Once you have compiled it, you can run `npm run bot` to automatically launch the server, log in, and start your bot.

#Server
The GTA V SocialClub server has a terrible, undocumented API. The `Server` in this repository has very clean endpoints, and will be documented when I have the time. The server is basicly node between you and the SocialClub server.
You can start the server with `npm run server`. You will see a chromium browser popup with the login page of SocialClub. After manually logging in, a new tab will open automaticly. Please do not touch this browser instance anymore.
From now on, you are ready to go! Endpoints can not be access via `http://localhost:3000/{endpoint}` (no `https` support yet).

#Wrapper
Accessing the Server with a webbrowser or an application like postman is of course not desirable. You will need some sort of wrapper for the server. You can make this is any programming language, but his module contains a wrapper build for NodeJS (also in TypeScript). An example command line application can be found in the `Example` folder.

#Example
Make sure the server is running, and start the example (please change the username to your username). The amount of commands is still very limited.
